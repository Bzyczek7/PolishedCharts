# Product Guidelines - TradingAlert

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Concise:** All UI labels, system logs, and notifications must be clear, technical, and direct. Avoid fluff or overly conversational language. 
- **Precision:** Use precise terminology (e.g., "Slippage," "Moving Average," "Websocket Connection") consistent with standard trading practices.

## Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Dark Mode by default. The UI should utilize a high-contrast theme with a dark background to reduce eye strain during long trading sessions.
- **Indicators:** Use distinct, vibrant colors (neon or pastel) for technical indicators and signals to ensure they stand out clearly against the dark background.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a unified color palette for different categories of information (e.g., Green for Bullish, Red for Bearish, Blue for Info).

## Design Principles
- **Low Latency:** Prioritize performance in both the frontend (rendering charts) and backend (processing signals). The user should feel that data is real-time.
- **Transparency:** The system must provide clear feedback on its state. This includes indicating active data connections, the status of the alert engine, and a clear log of triggered alerts.
- **Customization First:** The platform should be highly flexible. Users should be able to easily adjust chart layouts, indicator parameters, and notification settings without friction.
- **Information Density:** Design for high information density while maintaining clarity, allowing traders to monitor multiple data points simultaneously.
